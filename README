1) You will need to suck down FlickrApp and stick it in the root.

2) Someday APIApp will have it's own package on github, etc. It might also
   become part of the default FlickrApp package.

3) A lot of the stuff in geosuggestions/__init__.py will become part of the
   FlickrApp core. That's sitting on my laptop right now because I don't feel
   like doing Git Yoga.

4) This might actually be a very broken build. The jQuery ribbon thingy really
   kind of sucks, but I don't feel like writing one from scratch right now.

5) Uh. Stuff. With things.
